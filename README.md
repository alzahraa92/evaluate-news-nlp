# Introduction 
to Natural Language Processing
NLP is a subset of AI that provides computers ability to process or interact with natural human speech. In NLP, machine learning and deep learning are used on massive amounts of data to obtain the rules and understanding of nuance in human speech.

NLP on Human Voice
For example, everyone who has used Alexa or Google Assistant or other voice command systems knows that these devices are always improving, by collecting and interpreting voice data. Verbal interactions can be incredibly hard to decipher. Sarcasm, for instance, requires understanding not just words and grammar but the tone as well, and regional accents and ways of saying things have to be taken into account, not to mention coverage for all the major languages.

NLP on Text
An example is Grammarly editing tool, which parses the text that you write, and suggests if the tone is professional or not. Another example is the Smart Compose feature for Gmail that uses NLP to suggest words and statements based on your current context.
